[2/19/20, 2:20:04 PM] demi mol: Polina_

Strong style of imagery , different ways of visualising and approaching concepts on a typographic and visual way, bringing it back to my interest in analogue photography. Bringing my background back to the works.
[2/19/20, 2:20:27 PM] demi van venrooij: demim
[2/19/20, 2:20:32 PM] demi van venrooij: personal fasinations
preformance



wouldn't say a specific visual style but the medium meets the concept behind the works. form follows function. storybased.

abstract look at the subject that you tackle, finding new persectives on that. creating new stories from that.
[2/19/20, 2:22:05 PM] Polina Titova: DEMI_1

books, typography, small details, layout design, type design? (not standard type, but creative way of designing a type)
if she does some details, she does them fun, trying to connect to her background and personal side
pays a lot of attention to editing and a concept of a work
[2/19/20, 2:22:38 PM] demi mol: @31682749373 this is not homework we are helping each other with our letters
[2/19/20, 2:30:07 PM] demi mol: Demi1_

Strong typographic fascination and finding my different ways to translate that into different media. Researching with the way the book works from curating to binding. Adding some humoristic and light details to heavy and complicated concepts to give them a touch of “me”.  A neat and rhythmic style with a touch of pink.
[2/19/20, 2:30:32 PM] doga gönüllü: ah ok
[2/19/20, 2:30:33 PM] doga gönüllü: hahah
[2/19/20, 2:30:43 PM] doga gönüllü: i was confused
[2/19/20, 2:31:28 PM] demi van venrooij: polina

outspoken and onconventional way of design. with a focus on typography and creating pleasing images. finding ways to implement her interest for analogue and digital. has a way of making it look and feel like work that you made - from idea to design. making serious things look fun.
[2/19/20, 2:32:25 PM] Polina Titova: DEMI_2

simple and straightforward in her design decisions, 
strong design concepts that are most of the time based on a very casual ideas
creates designs that allows her to introduce the subject from a different perspective, an unexpected side
likes to make designs that speaks to the viewer by working in interactive field
performance art as a solid base for most of the projects
strong typographical decisions that support the concept of a project on a professional level

[3/11/20, 5:54:03 PM] Polina Titova: and in that case people pay for one more year, but they don’t have classes. only graduation project
[3/11/20, 5:54:16 PM] Polina Titova: so teachers are not busy with them
[3/11/20, 5:54:37 PM] demi mol: wow that would be rude tho
[3/11/20, 5:55:20 PM] Polina Titova: hah, it may be my way of thinking only because i’m from corrupted af country

[4/3/20, 10:35:04 AM] demi mol: ahhh oke
[4/3/20, 10:35:09 AM] demi mol: demi if you want to join me already
[4/3/20, 10:35:11 AM] demi mol: you can
[4/5/20, 11:15:13 AM] demi mol: I dont wanna do Jeroen
[4/5/20, 11:15:14 AM] demi mol: Help
[4/5/20, 11:15:15 AM] demi mol: Haha
[4/5/20, 11:15:19 AM] demi mol: I don't know what to do
[4/5/20, 1:15:24 PM] doga gönüllü: hello
[4/5/20, 1:15:27 PM] doga gönüllü: im alive
[4/5/20, 1:15:43 PM] doga gönüllü: can someone explain the hw for tomorrow, the face filter thing?
[4/5/20, 6:18:13 PM] Polina Titova: yes... I don't know how much help I will be  because I really didn't like the app. it is fucking horrible. measurments are all different some are connected to 0 and then you need  to go + or -, some are connected to 1 and then you go 0.008 or 1.002 to change position of the mask
[4/5/20, 6:18:24 PM] Polina Titova: so fucking angry with this app
[4/5/20, 6:19:27 PM] Polina Titova: I think I won't do anything for tomorrow. don't care enough
[4/5/20, 6:19:30 PM] Polina Titova: but
[4/5/20, 6:19:39 PM] Polina Titova: we need to make a mask
[4/5/20, 6:20:00 PM] demi mol: I didn’t do it either
[4/5/20, 6:20:29 PM] Polina Titova: she didn't show a lot.... basically she said: there are tutorials, good luck! Oh, she also said it is easy
[4/5/20, 6:21:16 PM] Polina Titova: do you have an app installed? you also need to have a google account to install it. great start
[4/5/20, 6:21:57 PM] Polina Titova: and that is amazing!!!!! I am personally very happy that you keep aliving :)
[4/5/20, 6:22:24 PM] doga gönüllü: I used this app last year so i have it
[4/5/20, 6:22:33 PM] Polina Titova: oh
[4/5/20, 6:22:43 PM] doga gönüllü: But i didnt make a face thing before, i made a surface tracker
[4/5/20, 6:22:50 PM] Polina Titova: so you probably know more than what I can tell you
[4/5/20, 6:22:58 PM] doga gönüllü: It is spark, right?
[4/5/20, 6:23:09 PM] Polina Titova: yes
[4/5/20, 6:23:20 PM] Polina Titova: on the left you can add objects
[4/5/20, 6:23:28 PM] doga gönüllü: Ok, i havent tried making a thing yet but i will
[4/5/20, 6:24:03 PM] Polina Titova: there you need to add first "face tracker" and then "face Mesh"
[4/5/20, 6:24:17 PM] doga gönüllü: I ll figure that out i guess
[4/5/20, 6:24:16 PM] Polina Titova: and connect them
[4/5/20, 6:24:37 PM] doga gönüllü: Is there any specifics for the mask? Or is it just, a mask?
[4/5/20, 6:24:37 PM] Polina Titova: you can also add new material.
[4/5/20, 6:24:57 PM] Polina Titova: and the rest is just with settings to faceMesh and Material
[4/5/20, 6:25:09 PM] Polina Titova: nope
[4/5/20, 6:25:13 PM] Polina Titova: nothing
[4/5/20, 6:25:21 PM] doga gönüllü: Oh ok
[4/5/20, 6:25:24 PM] doga gönüllü: Yea sure
[4/5/20, 6:25:35 PM] doga gönüllü: I ll just make smt super simple i guess
[4/5/20, 8:11:50 PM] doga gönüllü: ugh i dont want to 3d model anything to put it on my face really
[4/5/20, 8:31:17 PM] doga gönüllü: does it need to be a visible mask? i made tears, does it count?
‎[4/5/20, 8:31:30 PM] doga gönüllü: ‎image omitted
[4/5/20, 8:31:51 PM] doga gönüllü: there s a mask under there but not visible so it will track my eyes
[4/5/20, 8:39:45 PM] Polina Titova: yes!
[4/5/20, 8:39:51 PM] Polina Titova: that’s very good
[4/5/20, 8:39:53 PM] Polina Titova: :)
[4/5/20, 8:40:54 PM] doga gönüllü: ok, i will try to make it so that it will stop if the eyes are closed, so it will look like i actually worked on it
[4/5/20, 8:41:07 PM] doga gönüllü: then will upload
[4/5/20, 8:41:25 PM] doga gönüllü: animation is hard though, i still dont get it
[4/5/20, 8:44:49 PM] Polina Titova: I won’t even try to get it 😑
[4/5/20, 8:45:07 PM] doga gönüllü: yea i broke smt now its not working at all
[4/5/20, 8:45:10 PM] doga gönüllü: so 🤷‍♀
[4/6/20, 12:18:13 PM] Polina Titova: where is this log???
[4/6/20, 12:18:26 PM] Polina Titova: did we receive the link?
